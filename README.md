## Hey there! 👋

I'm Bruce, a builder and technology specialist based in San Diego, CA.

I design, deploy, and maintain robust infrastructure and custom technical solutions.

If an idea involves virtualization, network architecture, or custom fabrication, chances are I'll build it.

My main tech stack centers around server management, virtualization, and systems integration. My favorite tools are **Proxmox**, **Linux**, and **Dewalt** for the physical side.

I've got a selection of pinned projects, but one of my key focuses is on homelab architecture.

I've learned that a solid foundation—whether in code or construction—is the key to long-lasting quality.

### 🛠️ Systems & Tech Specs:

* **Virtualization:** Proxmox VE (running on Dell Precision T7820)
* **Hardware:** Dual Intel Xeon Gold 6130, 256GB RAM, NVIDIA RTX 3090 Ti.
* **Networking:** Focusing on robust, low-latency connectivity.
* **Programming:** Basic electrical and carpentry logic for custom projects.

### Fun Facts:

* I specialize in custom **furniture building** and residential additions.
* I prioritize **durability** and **cost-effectiveness** in all my projects.
* I served 4 years in the U.S. Marine Corps (0431 - Logistics).
